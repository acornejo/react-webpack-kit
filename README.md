# React + Webpack Kit

This requires a recent version of node and npm. At the time of writing
I am using node 6.3.1 and npm version 3.10.3.

1. Clone this repository

```
    git clone https://github.com/acornejo/react-webpack-kit.git
```

2. Change to the project folder and install the dependencies:

```
   cd react-webpack-kit
   npm install
```

3. Start the development server:

```
   npm start
```

4. Get started working by adding new components.
